### 🔹 LangChain RAG Demo
- **Overview:** Implementation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using LangChain for knowledge-based query handling. User uploads a pdf, PDF locally encoded to vector database and similarity search is run for semantic operations.
- **Technology:** ChromaDB, Ollama embeddings, OpenAI embeddings, LangChain, Local Vector Database.
- **Code Files:** [`RAG.ipynb`](./RAG_Llama/RAG.ipynb)

### 🔹 Training a Transformer Model with Tolstoy’s Books
- **Overview:** Trained a **Transformer-based language model** using works by Tolstoy to understand long-text dependencies and narrative style.
- **Technology:** TensorFlow, Keras.
- **Code Files:** [`transformers.ipynb`](./transformer_training/transformers.ipynb)

### 🔹 Reinforcement Learning Samples
- **Overview:** Implementations of both **model-based** and **model-free** reinforcement learning algorithms.
- **Code Files:**
  - [Model-Based RL](./reinforcement_learning/model_based_rl)
  - [Model-Free RL](./reinforcement_learning/model_free_rl)

### 🔹 LSTM Training Experiments
- **Overview:** Experimenting with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models for sequential data processing.
- **Technology:** TensorFlow.
- **Code Files:** [`lstm.ipynb`](./LSTM_training/lstm.ipynb)

### 🔹 Image Generation with GANs
